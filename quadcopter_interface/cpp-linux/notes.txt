How to program FPGA SPI flash
Converting .sof to .jic Files in the Intel Quartus Prime Software
To convert a .sof to a .jic file, perform the following steps:
On the File menu, select Convert Programming Files.
In the Convert Programming Files dialog box, select JTAG Indirect Configuration File (.jic) from the Programming file type drop down menu.
In the Configuration device field, specify the targeted serial configuration device.
In the File name field, browse to the target directory and specify an output file name.
Highlight the SOF Data in the Input files to convert window.
Click Add File.
Select the .sof file that you want to convert to a .jic file.
Click OK.
Highlight Flash Loader and click Add Device.
In the Select Devices dialog box, select the targeted FPGA that you are using to program the serial configuration device.
Click OK.
Click Generate.
Note: The Memory Map File check box is checked by default. The Intel® Quartus® Prime programmer generates the memory allocation mapping file along with the .jic file. You can turn off this option by turning off the check box.
